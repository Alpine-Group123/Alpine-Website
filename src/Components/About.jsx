            <br />
            Mountaineering, also called mountain climbing, the sport of
            attaining, or attempting to attain, high points in mountainous
            regions, mainly for the pleasure of the climb. Although the term is
            often loosely applied to walking up low mountains that offer only
            moderate difficulties, it is more properly restricted to climbing in
            localities where the terrain and weather conditions present such
            hazards that, for safety, a certain amount of previous experience
            will be found necessary. For the untrained, mountaineering is a
            dangerous pastime.
            <br /> <br />
            Unlike most sports, mountaineering lacks widely-applied formal
            rules, regulations, and governance; mountaineers adhere to a large
            variety of techniques and philosophies when climbing mountains.

                  Did you know? <br />
                  Mountaineering dates back to the early explorations of the
                  Alps in the 18th century. It evolved from scientific
                  expeditions into a sport by the 19th century, with famous
                  ascents like the first successful climb of Mont Blanc (1786)
                  and the first Everest summit (1953).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, mountaineering blends tradition with modern techniques,
                  pushing human endurance to new limits.
